### Description

- A man in his 80s, Baldrin has a wiry frame that may deceive many into believing he's frail. His skin is pale, with wrinkles that mark a lifetime of experience and arcane experimentation. His once-black hair has turned entirely silver, contrasting with the deep blue of his calculating eyes. Despite his apparent age, his movements are precise and deliberate. He wears dark robes adorned with numerous arcane symbols and glyphs, each telling of a spell or ritual of immense power.

### Role

Overseeing all magical practices and policy-making in Celest, Baldrin ensures the city's arcane pursuits are ethical, safe, and aligned with the greater good. His office issues licenses to mages, regulates arcane trade, and ensures safe utilization of the Origin's mana.
