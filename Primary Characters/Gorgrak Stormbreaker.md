## The Chef's Captain

Gorgrak is the captain of the ship of [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf]]. Although it is unknown how long [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] and Gorgrak have known each other they hold a loyal bond.

Gorgrak traveled with the group from Nave to Solem, and then through the Origin to Darken Post

## The Tormented Captain

During the [[Echoes of Deja Vu]] Gorgrak initially sensed trouble when the group landed in the cursed waters, but was soon also found on the ship nearby tormented.

	"The true shock came when they discovered Captain Gorgrak, crouched in a corner, wearing his captain's hat but looking feral and tormented. He had been stranded and gone mad, with his crew turning against him, leading to the demise of their previous counterparts."


Gorgrak then trusts the group and assists in their discovery of the Dopplegangers, narrowly making it out alive with the rest of the crew.
