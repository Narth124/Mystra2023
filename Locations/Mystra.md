According to the legends of Mystra, the continent was once a barren wasteland, with little to no signs of life. The only notable feature of the land was a large body of water at its centre, known as [[The Origin]].

[[The Origin]] was a swirling vortex of water, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. Its currents were so strong that it was said to be impossible to survive its depths. But there was something else that made the Origin so special. The waters were infused with pure mana, the magical essence that fuelled the spells of the most powerful wizards.

As time passed, the people of Mystra discovered that the mana-infused waters of the Origin could be used to create powerful magical artifacts and spells. They learned to harness the power of the Origin and began to use it to their advantage.

[[The Origin]] became the centre of magical study and experimentation on Mystra. Great towers were built around its edges, where wizards and sorcerers would conduct their research and hone their craft. The magical knowledge that was gained from studying the Origin allowed Mystra to become one of the most powerful magical nations in the world.

But the power of the Origin did not go unnoticed. Dark forces from across the world began to covet the magic of Mystra, and soon, the continent was embroiled in a series of devastating wars. The towers around the Origin were destroyed, and the magical knowledge of Mystra was lost.

During the wars, the Origin was heavily impacted by the constant fighting and use of magic. The surrounding areas were devastated, with large craters and scorched earth left in the wake of powerful spells and explosions. The waters of the Origin, once pure and imbued with magical energy, became corrupted and dark. The mana-infused waters were now toxic and dangerous, with many who ventured too close to the Origin suffering from magical radiation sickness.

The once-beautiful coastline of Mystra was also affected, with many of the seaside cities and towns suffering from heavy damage. Some were completely destroyed, while others struggled to survive in the aftermath of the wars.

Despite the damage, however, the people of Mystra were determined to rebuild and recover. The magical energies of the Origin were still strong, and the people knew that they could harness this power to restore their homeland. Over time, they learned to control and manipulate the magical energies, using them to heal the land and rebuild their cities.

As the centuries passed, Mystra slowly regained its former beauty and power. The waters of the Origin were purified, and the surrounding areas were restored to their former glory. The scars of the wars remained, but they served as a reminder of the strength and resilience of the people of Mystra.

Today, the Origin is still at the centre of Mystra, a constant reminder of the continent's magical roots. The mana-infused waters continue to be used to power spells and artifacts, and the towers that surround it are once again bustling with magical activity. [[The Origin]] remains a mysterious and powerful force, and the people of Mystra continue to study its secrets, unlocking the full potential of magic on their continent.
