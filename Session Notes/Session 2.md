# SESSION NOTES:

- The next morning at dawn we board the ship in the harbour. Supplies are loaded onto the ship.
- The ship is very large - 4 stories tall.
	- A large captains quarters
	- Below that two or three extra rooms
- A large smiling [[[[Half-Orc]]|[[half-o]]rc]] man, wearing a captain’s hat. He welcomes us.
	- [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker]]

	- [[Elisa Nightwind]] - First Officer
	- She tells us we will each have stations to man
	- We are free to explore the ship except for the bottom deck, which is for the crew only (she seems a bit suspicious).

- In the night [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]], [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] and [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]] go to investigate the bottom deck.
	- The second from bottom deck seems more like a crew quarters
	- No stairs to the next level. We find a hatch at the back of the boat.
	- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] picks a fight with a [[half-orc]] as a distraction and the Akuktuks go down the hatch.
	- It’s pitch dark. They hear a rustling of chains and a deep breathing and a hiss
	- [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]] lights a candle. There’s a fragrant moss and earthy type smell. Nestled within the space is a small garden/forest. On all fours is some kind of young girl adorned with flowers and leaves. Her eyes are fearful. Looks like an 8 year old child, green hair and skin. She is hissing.
	- The ground genuinely looks like a small forest with a stream, boulders, waterfall etc.
	- [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] offers her fish and she takes it and eats.
	- Her name is [[Blossom]] It’s almost like she’s learning the language as she speaks.
	- They burned down her forest and captured her
	- There’s a small silver tree behind her and she says she can’t leave the forest. The tree is her home. If it dies, she dies.
	- [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] thinks she might be a [[Dryad]] “The Spirit of the Forest”
- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] is eventually knocked unconscious and tied up on the deck. He apologises and pretends he was just looking for his station on the crew, and that fighting is what he’s good at.
- [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] and [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]] talk to [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Monti]] and ask what he knows about Dryads. He doesn’t know anything.
- They ask [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] who is still going in and out of consciousness. He tells them he knows all about Dryads and they should free her, and they believe him.

	- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] catches an Opal Eel - 11 feet long (3gp)
- The crew enjoy a nice meal.
- [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]] asks [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] to help pick the locks on the chains.
	- They go back to [[Blossom]] and [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] attempts to pick the lock, eventually unlocking it.
	- [[Blossom]] has aged, she now looks 17 or 18 years old
	- They help her take the silver tree and replant it in a pot so she will be able to take it with her.
	- The plan is for her to remain in the room until the ship docks somewhere she can sneak off and escape into the forest.
	- A mist starts filling the room
- The whole ship becomes enveloped by the mist both inside and outside and navigation becomes difficult.
- Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] calls us, and we go to meet him on deck.
- There is an eerie silence, no sound of what should be a bustling port.
- We enter the harbour and the town slowly reveals itself. But there are no people in sight. A crew member moors the ship to the docks.
- There’s a chill in the air. [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] steps off the boat.
- [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] sends us to go find out what’s happening. He needs an ingredient (a special duck) from [[Solem]] and refuses to move onwards.
	- We enter the town. We hear creepy breathing. We stealth and [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] scouts ahead.
	- He finds a person in front of a tavern, standing, breathing heavily and coughing.
	- [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] pushes open the door and looks inside - no one inside.
	- We move forward and [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Monti]] throws a stone at the person. He flinches but doesn’t seem to be able to see, and continues to breathe heavily.
	- We talk to him and he says, “The Mayor knows”.
	- We make our way to the town centre and find the Mayor’s house.
	- [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] gets lost in the fog and finds a woman with ‘watery features’. She has jagged teeth and red eyes. She breathes mist at him and he inhales it.
		- She says ‘8 more’
		- He keeps coughing
	- He finds the rest of the group. [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] gives him his thermal cube to keep him warm. 
	- We get to the door of the Mayor’s house. The Mayor answers. He is afraid. He says he’s ‘on 7’. He lets us in and we talk to him.
		- They were struggling with the town taxes
		- A rich lady arrived - called herself [[Vera]]
		- “Have you heard of the “Leviathan’s Tear”
		- [[Solem]] is named after one of the guardians of the great leviathan’s of the sea. It shed a great sapphire orb when it died. The mayor’s ancestor married the guardian. The tear protects the town.
		- He sold the sapphire to the lady.
		- Soon after an angry sea spirit cursed the town with the mist sickness. It slowly spread more and more, infecting the town’s people. It hinders movement and breathing.
		- Within 10 days people fall asleep never to wake up and eventually die.
		- He sent some people to find the woman at [[Darken Post]], she works for a collector there.
		- The number means the number of days you have to live.
		- Bring the tear back and the spirit will be appeased.
		- There is a faster route to [[Darken Post]] through [[the Origin]] (would take less than 24hrs each way).
		- He gives us a map of [[Solem]].
	- [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] tries to ask his otter (now called Jacob) for help. He gives him a smooth rock. It’s just a rock. He teaches Jacob to say [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] but it comes out as Dick.
- We go back to [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] and explain. We manage to convince him that the price for the duck will be freeing the town from the mist.
	- We convince the captain we need to go through [[the Origin]]. It’s a crazy plan but it’s the only way to save the town, it’s people and especially (to [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]]) the ducks.
	- The captain takes a puff on his pipe, his eyes glow blue, and he says “All hands on deck, we sail for [[the Origin]]”.

# SESSION RECAP:
## "Misty Whispers and a Lost Sapphire"

At the break of dawn, a group of adventurers consisting of [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]], [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]], [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]], [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Monti]], [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]], and [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] set sail aboard a ship captained by the friendly [[half-orc]], [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker]]. They were led to luxurious quarters and informed by the first officer, [[Elisa Nightwind]], that they were free to explore the ship except for the bottom deck.

Intrigued by this restriction, [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]], [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]], and [[Arthur Pebbleton|Arthur]] snuck into the bottom deck at night, where they discovered a serene forest-like environment. Here, they found a young girl named [[Blossom]], who appeared to be a [[Dryad]], bound to a small silver tree. They learned that she was captured after her forest was burned down and that she cannot leave the silver tree as her life is linked to it.

Meanwhile, the group participated in a fishing contest on the ship. They caught various unusual fish, and [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] managed to save an otter-like creature, which he named Jacob.

The group decided to help [[Blossom]]. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] picked the locks on her chains, and they replanted the silver tree in a pot so she could take it with her. Suddenly, a mysterious mist enveloped the ship and [[Solem]], the port they were approaching.

Upon arrival, they found the town deserted and shrouded in mist. Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] and the crew were confused by the silence, and the group was tasked by [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] to investigate. The adventurers ventured into the town, encountering a resident who directed them to the Mayor for answers.

The Mayor revealed that he had sold a sapphire called the "Leviathan's Tear," which was believed to protect the town. Since then, a sea spirit cursed the town with a suffocating mist. The adventurers resolved to retrieve the sapphire from [[Darken Post]] through a shortcut called [[the Origin]] to lift the curse.

With determination, they convinced Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] to set sail for [[the Origin]], commencing a perilous quest to save [[Solem]] and its inhabitants.
