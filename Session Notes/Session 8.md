	- He asks if the Akuktuqs are his pets, as they step in front of [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] they tell him they are not pets, but friends.

# SESSION RECAP:
## "A Night of Secrets"

The crew was decked out in their finest gear for the council meeting, which was held in a skyship mansion adorned with flowers and floating in the sky. The grand entrance was marked by a red carpet and attended by numerous servants. Their purpose was not only to attend the meeting but also to provide protection for Lord [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]].

Upon arrival, they were greeted by [[Baldron]] the Archwizard, a gnome surrounded by smoke from his pipe. This was confusing for [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]], who did not remember [[Baldron]] as a gnome. The crew was welcomed into the casino on the bottom floor of the ship, given 100 gold worth of chips each, and encouraged to enjoy the surroundings while waiting for the council members to arrive.

As the council members arrived, the crew engaged in various activities, winning and losing at games, gaining favors from council members, and partaking in drinks and conversation. However, tension escalated when [[Huruk Boneclaw]] and his warbride Lurka entered the room. Huruk, a large orc, recognized [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] and taunted him about his past and the killing of his parents, leading to a physical altercation.

After the council meeting concluded, the atmosphere was disrupted by the swift and secretive exit of several key figures, including Huruk, [[Baldron]], the bishop, and Valdron. Suspicious, [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Krylancelo]] transformed into a bat and eavesdropped on their conversation, discovering a temporary alliance formed between the bishop and [[Baldron]] to 'maintain the balance' and reshape the world's destiny.

The crew decided to confide in [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]] about their discoveries, using a chess game as a subtle way to communicate. [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]] revealed a document containing detailed information about the council members, exposing deep corruption within the city. He believed that an attack was imminent, staged by the Illustrious Five, who were funded by [[Baldron]].

[[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]] also revealed that he was part of the Pridelock Agency, a group of detectives working in the shadows. The session ended with the crew contemplating their next move, realizing that their memories might have been altered and that they were entangled in a web of deceit and corruption.
