# SESSION NOTES:

- We approach the foreboding entrance of the Darken Mines.
	- The mines sit right on the edge of the disaster zone surrounding [[the Origin]].
	- They are filled with ores and gems imbued with corrupted mana essence.
	- There are lit runes above the entrance of the mine and a [[dwarf]]’s body lying outside. Boron tells us it’s the foreman. There are 3 sharp gashes through the chest and armour. He’s holding a journal with a map in it.
	- [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] walks up and the tablet flashes into flames and a tome appears. She opens it and forgets everything about it. She tries again and reads a translation of the runes on the entrance of the mines. They read as Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Spirit.
	- The book has the following words inside:
		- “Fire consumes, but is quenched by water’s embrace
		- Earth nurtures the seed, but is scattered by the wind
		- Air dances freely but yields to the stone
		- Spirit binds all, yet is bound by none”
	- Pedestals appear in front of the entrance, sitting upon them are:
		- a large empty bow.
		- a bonsai tree
		- a fae spirit
		- an unlit brazier
	- Boron thinks it’s a seal that the foreman put in place. We’ll need to solve the puzzle and break the seal to enter.
	- [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Kryl]] finds a flask filled with a clear liquid on the foreman.
	- We solve the puzzle by placing the different elements in the right combination.
- We enter into a nice entryway with equipment laid out. It’s obvious that people left in a hurry. There are lunches left on the ground etc.
- In the Foreman’s office there’s a floating spectral [[dwarf]]. We talk to him and he leaves through a wall. There’s a journal in front of a skeleton - looks like it’s been eaten.
	- It talks about rumours about spirits in the mines and want to keep up production levels. The last entry is from a week ago.
	- [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] finds a safe - it seems quite intricate. We eventually get it open. Inside is a sack with a bunch of gold inside (40gp). We put it in the [[bag of holding]].
- We enter the main mining zone. All mined out. There’s another rest stop for workers, it looks abandoned.
	- Two more spirits are mining in the corner.
	- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] pretends to help the spirits piling up rubble
	- In the meantime the rest of them tie off a rope across the pit ahead.
	- The spirits pass through the rubble and disappear. We hear screaming.
	- We make our way over to the other side of the pit.
- There’s an entrance to an ancient golden temple with steps up to an arched entrance. Appears to have been uncovered by the miners.
	- There are numerous corpses of dwarves. They look like husks, with desiccated bodies and burned out eyes.
	- [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] notices a shining light coming from under one of the corpses. The corpse is clutching an amulet.
	- [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] picks it up with [[mage hand]]. The gem is captivating. It looks almost like the night itself is within the gem. The necklace is made of silver and looks like tree vines. She puts it in the [[bag of holding]].
- We approach the entryway of the golden temple, filled with deep shadows.
- [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] touches the amulet. It is freezing and cold to the touch. Her fingers are white and chilled.
- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] and [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] look into the dark portal. They see a terrifying dark figure in front of us.
- [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] goes in and throws a dagger at the creature. We enter combat with the Soul Devourer.
- We defeat the creature and it’s shadow minions by using the gem to dispel all the shadows. We get the following items:
	- Full set of plate [[armor]] - pitch black
	- Pitch black dagger
	- 2 rings - 1 pitch black gem, 1 ruby
- There is also an immense horde of treasure against the back wall, along with writing on the wall that says ‘to those who steal this gold, the shadows will come for them’.
- We discuss whether we should take some…

# SESSION RECAP:
## "Shadows of the Darken Mines: A Riddle, a [[Ghost]], and a Soul Devourer"

In the foreboding shadow of the Darken Mines, the adventurers discovered a grim welcome: the corpse of the dwarf foreman, marked with three deep gashes. The runes above the entrance hinted at a puzzle; the elements of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Spirit guided the way.
  
A tome, materializing from flames, provided the riddle they needed to solve. Five pedestals, bearing symbols of the elements, required precise alignment. With clever thinking, they unlocked the path, revealing signs of a hasty abandonment within.

Upon entering, they encountered the spectral form of a [[dwarf]], who led them to a journal detailing rumors of spirits and a hidden treasure. Their curiosity piqued, they found a safe, unlocking it to discover gold.

The main mining zone lay abandoned, save for the ghostly miners working away, oblivious to their fate. Crossing a pit, the party discovered an ancient golden temple. The corpses of dwarves, with burned-out eyes, lay scattered around, one clutching an amulet with a gem as dark and mysterious as the night itself.

A chilling touch, a glimpse into a dark portal, and the party found themselves face to face with a Soul Devourer. In a battle of wits and might, they triumphed, finding pitch-black armor, dagger, and rings, and an immense horde of treasure.

A warning on the wall spoke of shadows that would come for those who stole the gold. Their path now lay open, filled with possibilities and perils, as they debated whether to heed the warning or seize the glittering fortune that lay before them.
