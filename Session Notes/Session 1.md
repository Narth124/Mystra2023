# SESSION RECAP:
## "In the Shadow of the Yeti's Den"

The adventure resumes at the mouth of a foreboding cave. The lifeless body of Steven lies in a state of shock, a map clenched tightly in his hand. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] uncovers an iridescent amulet on a fallen [[Kobold]] mage, while also detecting a hidden trap at the cave entrance. Following a brief respite and a magical performance by [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]], the party ventures into the cavernous depths.

The party selects the left path, leading them towards a crystal-filled grotto. However, a misstep results in a volatile reaction from the crystals, causing injury but also providing valuable shards for collection. Among the spoils, [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] secures a collection of small shards, while [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] obtains a large, green glowing chunk and a similarly sized blue one.

The group then proceeds down the opposite path. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] scouts ahead, overhearing the chatter of Kobolds. With a combination of stealth and magic, they manage to bypass the [[Kobold]] village undetected.

The journey continues until they encounter an immense Yeti, drinking from the sought-after spring. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] and [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] attempt to outwit the creature, leading it away from the spring. Their ruse results in a fierce battle, culminating in the defeat of the Yeti. Following the encounter, [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]], [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]], and [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] imbibe from the spring, experiencing a rejuvenating glow and filling six waterskins with the magical waters.

A fruitful search of the area uncovers 20 gold pieces, a clam containing a shiny object, and a pair of glowing boots (Boots of Ethereal Stride). [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] also finds a [[Bag of Holding]], complete with gold, healing potions, trap-making supplies, and rope.

After harvesting parts from the fallen Yeti, the party stealthily navigates back to the village, bringing along Steven's body. Their glow from the spring water fades without consequence.

Upon presenting their haul to [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]], the party is rewarded handsomely. They provide six waterskins of spring water, three large rock crystals, and several smaller crystals. In return, they receive payment and an invitation to accompany [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] to [[Solem]] as his guards. Negotiations conclude with a daily rate of 60 gold pieces, and the newly formed "A, B & Company" ([[Arthur Benedict and Company|ABC's]]) is born.

The session ends on a somber note as they return Steven's body to his father, learning of the man's life and his apparent betrayal by his former party. After helping bury Steven, they board [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]]'s ship, setting sail for [[Solem]] under the cover of [[darkness]]. The true story of their adventure, like the sea they navigate, runs deeper than they initially suspected.
