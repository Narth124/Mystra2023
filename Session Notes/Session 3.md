# SESSION RECAP:
## "Echoes of Deja Vu: Charming Deceptions"

As the crew sailed towards the enigmatic Origin, an awe-inspiring whirlpool of magic and power, the adventurers braced themselves for the unknown. The air hummed with an eerie energy, and the ship almost glided through the turbulent waters of the vortex.

Navigating through the mist that swirled around them, the party spotted a peculiar sight ahead - a ship, identical to their own, anchored nearby. An unsettling feeling washed over them, as if they were experiencing a haunting case of deja vu.

Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]], sensing trouble, sent the party in a dinghy to investigate the mysterious vessel. The silence on the deserted ship was deafening, and as they climbed aboard, they discovered six lifeless bodies. Shockingly, five of the corpses were hanging from the mast, while the sixth had been brutally stabbed.

It was a gruesome sight to behold, especially when they realized that the corpses were exact copies of themselves. The feeling of dread deepened as [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]]'s lifeless body lay among them. Had they somehow witnessed a glimpse of their own future?

They found [[Krylancelo Brynmoreeee|Monti]] missing and encountered a young man, the real [[Krylancelo Brynmoreeee|Monti]], who had been hiding from someone or something. He revealed his true identity and confessed to a dark secret - hiding from [[Celeste]], the capital city.

The true shock came when they discovered Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]], crouched in a corner, wearing his captain's hat but looking feral and tormented. He had been stranded and gone mad, with his crew turning against him, leading to the demise of their previous counterparts.

Among the chaos, they found a diary detailing the crew's descent into madness, chronicling their ill-fated expedition to the deserted ship. It mentioned a certain Simmons, not listed on the crew manifest, who seemed to be a source of morale and comfort for the crew during their troubled times.

With the influence of a mysterious charm affecting their thoughts, the adventurers struggled to piece together the puzzle. They threw the future diary overboard, hoping to break free from its enchanting effects.

As they attempted to defy the charm, they confronted Simmons, only to find their memories clouded by confusing bouts of deja vu. The truth eluded them, and Simmons' true intentions remained hidden.

The evening passed in a haze as they feasted with the crew. They retired to separate rooms, unaware of the impending danger. In the middle of the night, they awoke to find their rooms invaded by transformed doppelgangers of fellow crew members, attacking them one by one.
