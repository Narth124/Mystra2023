# SESSION NOTES:

- We all survive but are pretty messed up. 
- [[Primary Characters/Elroth Silverleaf|Elroth]] and [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] both also survive.
- We run belowdecks, and there’s a bloodbath, all of the crew are dead in their hammocks.
- We check on [[Blossom]]. They didn’t find her and she’s also alive, but scared.
- We search the rest of the ship, there’s no one else on board.
- [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] realises our course has been set to the centre of the whirlpool
- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] sees a vision of his grandmother who warns him to turn hard to port avoiding the rocks. [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] helps [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] pull the wheel to the side while [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] and [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] help pulling the sails.
- [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]’s ghostly Grandmother, Astrid, keeps warning him as they try to escape the storm. The party works together to keep the ship on course.
- We eventually escape the vortex. Astrid fades from [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]’s vision and one of his eyes begins to glow red and he can now see the currents that will lead us in the right direction - Ancestral Eye of the Navigator (not sure how it works yet).
- [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] tells us a bit about himself. He is from Valor’s Reach. He grew up around his father and learned martial abilities, but wanted to pursue magic. He went to the Academy at [[Celest]]. While there he found out about a ‘racket’. He snuck into the headmaster’s office and found out something ‘bad’. They were scamming people. He was almost caught by the headmaster, he ran away and has been hiding from them since. He ended up in [[Nave]]. His real name is ‘[[Krylancelo Brynmore]]’.
- [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] loots the corpses and throws their money into the ocean as an offering to her god.
- We emerge from [[the origin]] and into calmer seas. We go through the ‘Guardians’, two immense statues rising from the waters. They are statues of gods with hands raised forward. One is like the sun and the other like the moon. Amazing carvings are in the base of the statues.
- We approach [[Darken Post]]. Smoke/smog rises above it. It is known for its diverse market. Ruled by a mysterious figure known as [[Lucien|the Shadow]]. He single-handedly keeps peace in [[Darken Post]]. He is the collector of the artifact we’re looking for.
- We reach the docks. Elroth offers to find more crew. [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] will deal with the bodies. We think we were on the seas for 20 hours.
- We spend a long rest on the boat and then go out into the city to scout out [[Lucien|the Shadow]]’s manor house.
- [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Kryl]] uses his familiar to scout the manor house, it’s shrouded in shadow. There are 3 guards visible.
- One group approach the guards and attempt to convince them they are a cleaning service known as ‘Beak and Squeak’. They don’t believe them and they try and charm the guards. They are escorted inside. Meanwhile [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] and [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] jump over the wall and set off an alarm, but are able to hide in the grounds.
- [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] is hiding outside the manor grounds
- The other group are led to [[[[Lucien]]|[[Lucien|t]]he Shadow]] through a library, past chandeliers, candles etc. [[Lucien|The Shadow]] is a slender man with high cheekbones, black clothing and fangs.
- He sees through their lies and the team tells him the truth about why they’re here.
- His first name is [[Lucien]].
- They tell him about the curse and he tastes [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Kryl]]’s blood to confirm it. 
- He tells us about the Darken Mines and the ‘Nocturn Gem’ that is mined there. His men have uncovered a tomb, and men are going missing. No one wants to go into the mines anymore. He asks us to clear the mine in return for the Leviathan’s Tear.
- We sign a contract and he gives us horses to get to the mines.
- We go talk to the miners in the pub. Boron tells us about screams in the cave, and a thing that grabbed one of the miner’s soul through his throat and ate it. Lots of monsters, at least 8. They found a cavern with a giant archway and strange symbols - underground ancient ruins from the war.
- He ran and got away with a tablet with some text on it. He gives us the tablet and we give him a fish in return. It’s in Infernal, [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] can read it.
- Boron agrees to take us as far as the arch.
- We leave for the mines.

# SESSION RECAP:
## "Haunted Seas and Hidden Agendas: The Pact of Darken Post"

The violent altercation with their transformed doppelgangers left the crew bruised and battered, but alive. They emerged from the melee to discover a bloodbath below deck; all crew members lay dead in their hammocks. The frightened [[dryad]] [[Blossom]] was the sole survivor, having remained undiscovered during the onslaught. The ghostly figure of [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]'s grandmother, Astrid, made a sudden appearance, warning them of impending doom.

The course was set perilously towards the heart of the Origin, the colossal whirlpool. Working in unison, the team warded off disaster; [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] and [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]] deftly adjusted their course, while [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] and [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] strained at the sails. Aided by Astrid's spectral guidance, they skirted the lethal rocks and the fierce currents. As the vortex receded, [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]'s eye blazed a vibrant red, an inheritance of his ancestors - the Ancestral Eye of the Navigator.

In the wake of the ordeal, [[Krylancelo Brynmore|Monti]] revealed his true identity as [[Krylancelo Brynmore]] from Valor's Reach, a fugitive on the run from the Academy at [[Celest]], where he had uncovered a sinister scam. As [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]] performed a ritual offering to her god with the fallen crew's loot, they traversed calmer seas, beholding the majestic twin statues, the Guardians, greeting them at the mouth of [[the Origin]].
  
They docked at [[Darken Post]], a city renowned for its bustling market and enigmatic ruler, [[Lucien|the Shadow]]. Entrusted with the task of retrieving an artifact, the group set off to reconnoitre [[Lucien|the Shadow]]'s manor. The charm offensive of 'Beak and Squeak' cleaning service yielded mixed results; they found themselves escorted into the manor, while their companions evaded an activated alarm to infiltrate the grounds.

Inside the manor, they faced [[Lucien|the Shadow]], revealed to be a man named [[Lucien|The Shadow]] with a vampiric appearance. The group confessed the true purpose of their visit, unveiling the curse on [[Solem]] and their search for the Leviathan's Tear. [[Lucien]], intrigued, offered them a deal: they could claim the Tear if they agreed to investigate the Darken Mines, where his miners had been disappearing mysteriously.

Armed with knowledge from Boron, a miner who had narrowly escaped the horrors within the mines, the group set off to face the unknown. They received a tablet inscribed in Infernal, hinting at ancient underground ruins from the war, and a dread tale of a soul-devouring entity. The contract with [[Lucien]] signed, they departed for the mines, their journey threaded with danger, and the promise of the Leviathan's Tear awaiting their success.
