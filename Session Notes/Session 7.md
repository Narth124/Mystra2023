# SESSION RECAP:
## "A Return, A Forest, and The City of Wonder"

After their eventful retrieval of the Leviathan's Tear from [[Darken Post]], our adventurers made their way back to [[Solem]]. The treacherous waters of the Origin posed a challenge, with [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]'s Ancestral Eye proving invaluable. Yet as they distanced themselves from the Origin, the Eye's power dimmed, seemingly tethered to the massive whirlpool's energies.

Upon their return to [[Solem]], the city seemed to hold its breath, veiled in mist and an unsettling stillness. A guide, sporting the visage of a shark, led them to the Mayor's dwelling, where a ghostly priestess awaited the Leviathan's Tear. With its return, the city took a breath of relief; the mist dispersed, the priestess regained her mortal form, and [[Solem]] sprung back to life.

The promised chickens, which turned out to be sizable emus, held a special allure for Elroth, being a coveted delicacy in [[Solem]].

The challenges didn’t end there. [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Krylancelo]], grappling with the hunger of his nascent vampirism, attempted to quench it using his cursed blade. While it did feed him, it also harmed those he fed on. He decided that feeding like the more seasoned vampires would be safer, a method more 'old-fashioned' in nature.

The journey took another turn as they navigated towards the Silvermist Forest, on the borders of elven lands. Their mission was simple yet dangerous: safely escort [[Blossom]], the dryad under their protection, to her home. With Captain [[Gorgrak Stormbreaker|Gorgrak]]'s reservations voiced, the crew still chose to press on. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] and [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]]’s stealthy maneuvers through the forest waters ensured they evaded elven patrols. As gratitude, [[Blossom]] bestowed upon [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] a special branch with diverse capabilities. Both [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] and [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] also became recipients of [[Blossom]]'s Boon, a gift they subsequently shared with the rest of the crew in a rather unexpected manner.

In a light-hearted moment, [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] engaged in training Jacob, his otter with fey ties, teaching the creature the joys of dance.

Celeste beckoned them next. True to its reputation as the City of Wonder, its majestic spires sparkled against the backdrop of the sky, while the gardens of the Melora Preserve provided a calming presence with their mystically glowing trees.

Elroth's knowledge guided them to Lord [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]]'s imposing manor. A Leonin of repute, [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]]'s control over magical beings was renowned. Their meeting over tea turned into an offer to join his 'Menagerie of Fools', an honor that held both rewards and obligations. After careful deliberation, an agreement was reached.

The Enchanted Forest, where they found their accommodations, was nothing short of magical. Each crew member was allocated a glade, intricately woven to resonate with their individual strengths and personalities. [[Vyren Steler|Vyren]] found himself surrounded by shadows, while [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] was transported to a tundra-esque haven.

Day two in Celeste was one of discovery. [[Benedict Waddleton III|Benedict]] delved into the mysteries of his cards at the Temple of Allhammer. [[Ragnar Frostfang|Ragnar]] stumbled upon a treasure trove at a local armory in the market. [[Isadora Hellfire|Isadora]]'s bond with her Ancient Companion led her on a unique journey, while [[Krylancelo Brynmor|Krylancelo]]'s fears of corruption were addressed by a grateful [[Thalion Everwood|Thalion]].

As the second day in Celeste waned, they prepped for the imminent Council meeting, eager and anticipative of the night's events.
